Hi everyone!

My name is Maya and I'm a Photonic Science and Engr major in my sophmore year. I do colorguard and am a part of the Starlet Knights. Other activities I'm involved with include Habitat for Humanity and the Burnett Honors College. My current TV obsession is New Girl, and theough I'm not currently reading anything I do love books.
